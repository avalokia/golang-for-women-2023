## Final Project - Basic Trade API
The final project is to create an application called BasicTrade. The admin (seller) can create a product, storing the product's image, and create variant for the product.

## Environment
In my local environment, I used **PostgreSQL** for the database. Thus, the package that I imported in `db.go` is `"gorm.io/driver/postgres"`. In cases where other database is used, please change accordingly.

For an example of the .env file, there's an `env.example` file in the repository.

**The .env file is ignored from being submitted into the repository, so please create a new .env file before executing the program**

## Endpoints
The postman collection is provided in `Base Trade API - Devi Tara Avalokita.postman_collection` file.
The `url` and the `port` is set as an environment variable that can be changed accordingly.
